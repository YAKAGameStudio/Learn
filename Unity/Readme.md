## Step-by-Step
### Check your system
You should be already up to date, but double check that you have a 64 bits Windows 10.
All requirements are on : (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html)

### Install Unity Hub
Unity Hub is a standalone application that streamlines the way you find, download, and manage your Unity Projects and installations.
You will use the Hub at least to:
- Manage your Unity account and Editor licenses.
- Create your Project, and manage the installation of multiple versions of the Editor.

#### Get started
Download the Unity hub on: (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) then run it.
Depending your situation, you may have to acquire a license.

#### One Step installer
The great thing with the Unity Hub is that you don’t have anything to choose except the install location.
> Don’t change the name to Unity as this is the location used to install the Unity Engine (see below)

### Install Unity
#### Choose your release
After Unity Hub is install, you should go to Installs, then click to ADD and select the version you want (or need).
> Tips: you can upgrade your existing projects, but cannot downgrade.
> 
> Be sure that the release you choose is the best one

You can have several Unity release installed on your computer. Each times, modules will be reinstalled.

#### Choose modules you need.
At least, I recommend having Visual Studio Community. It’s a fully-featured, extensible, free IDE for creating modern applications for Android, iOS, Windows, as well as web applications and cloud services we will use later on.
Visual Studio Community is free as well as Visual Studio Code, but it’s more easier to manage project and extend them later, from my point of view.

#### You are ready to create
When the installation is done, I recommend restarting your computer. It’s not mandatory but it’s a good practice to avoid installer running in background.
